## The Best Sound Card Recorder


</div>

### Description

I was wondering if copying protected WMAs to an audio CD was legal, and if it was, how I would do it. The only way I found that works, is TuneBite (http://www.tunebite.com), however I would have to to pay for it. It seemed simple enough to remake in Visual Basic. It seems to me, that my program works just as well as TuneBite. It records sound directly from your sound card so any clicks, beeps, and other sounds will interfere with the recording. The GUI may not be so good but at least it works. I give full credit to whoever I got most of this code from. I removed the WAV to MP3 control since I wanted this code to be as simple as possible. Please give me a rating, give lots of feedback, and improvements! Also, for some reason many players can't play the saved wave files, so you'll have to find a converter that can convert it to a supported format. You can convert the wave files to MP3, simply by dragging your wave file directly into the lame.exe file. Please send me images to use for my GUI. KEEP GIVING ME RATINGS AND COMMENTS NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO I UPLOADED THIS!!!
